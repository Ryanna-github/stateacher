# Profile

![Di Wu](https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2016/09/COMM_wu_di_bios-738x714.jpeg)

# Biography[English]
Di Wu is a biostatistician working in the bioinformatics field. She has developed novel statistical bioinformatics methods to handle biomedical and genomics data. She also has developed gene set testing methods with high citations, in the empirical Bayesian framework, to take care of small complex design and genewise correlation structure.  

Dr. Wu has applied data integration strategy to identify the potential cell of origin for different breast cancer subtypes in silicon (at WEHI). Her recent projects have focused on genomic data based drug repurposing (at Harvard). She is now working on novel mediator analysis-based data integration tools to infer the likely causal relation across multiple levels of genomic, microbiome and metabolites (at UNC).  

Her new project has more microbiome and Electrical Medical Records components since the announcement of her joint position in the UNC School of Dentistry the Department of Biostatistics and the Carolina Health Informatics Program in 2015.

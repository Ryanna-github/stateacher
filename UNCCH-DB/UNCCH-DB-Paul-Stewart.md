# Biography[English]
Dr. Paul W. Stewart is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics. 

His expertise and interests in the development and application of statistical strategies and methods for design and analysis of biomedical studies are well-suited for biomedical research, collaboration, and consultation. Dr. Stewart has more than 35 years of experience in research design, statistical computation, interpretive analysis, collaboration with biomedical investigators, leadership of biostatistics core units for clinical studies, and service as chief biostatistician on the Scientific Review Subcommittee of the UNC School of Medicine IRB. For ten years, he directed both the Biostatistics Core of the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at UNC and the Biostatistics Core of the UNC Center for AIDS Research (CFAR). He also has experience directing a Collaborative Studies Coordinating Center unit for the NHLBI Multicenter DELTA Program and led biostatistics collaborations in an NHLBI Pediatric Pulmonary Specialized Center of Research. 

Dr. Stewart has 8 years of experience teaching a course on ‘Principles of Statistical Consulting and Collaboration’, and more than 10 years of experience teaching graduate courses in the advanced theory of linear statistical models and linear algebra in the UNC Department of Biostatistics.  

He has extensive experience in statistical consulting and collaboration with the US EPA and the pharmaceutical industry. He represents the Department of Biostatistics on the Conflict of Interest Committee of the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. For the journal Pediatric Pulmonology, Dr. Stewart serves as the Associate Editor for Research Design and Biostatistical Analysis.

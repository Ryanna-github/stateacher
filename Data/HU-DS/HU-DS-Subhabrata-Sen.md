# Profile

![Subhabrata Sen](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~sus977/pic.JPG)

# Biography[English]

I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), Harvard University. My research interests span Applied Probability, Statistics, and Machine Learning.

I was a Schramm postdoc at [Microsoft Research New England](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-new-england/) and [MIT Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu/) during 2017-19. I graduated from the [Stanford Statistics Department](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) in 2017, where I was jointly advised by [Prof Amir Dembo](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~adembo/) and [Prof Andrea Montanari](http://web.stanford.edu/~montanar/). Prior to joining Stanford, I received my undergraduate and Masters degrees in Statistics from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](http://www.isical.ac.in/).

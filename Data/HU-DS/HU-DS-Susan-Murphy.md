# Biography[English]

She grew up in rural [Louisiana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana "Louisiana"), and is "a serious hockey player."[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-1) She graduated from [Louisiana State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_University "Louisiana State University") with a B.S. and from the [University of North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina "University of North Carolina") with a Ph.D.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-macfound-2) Her 1989 dissertation, _Time-Dependent Coefficients in a Cox-Type Regression Model_, was supervised by [Pranab K. Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranab_K._Sen "Pranab K. Sen").[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-3)

Dr. Murphy was an Assistant and Associate Professor of Statistics at [Pennsylvania State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University "Pennsylvania State University") from fall 1989 to fall 1997.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-4) She was an Associate and full Professor of Statistics at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan "University of Michigan") from spring 1998 to summer 2017. She is a Professor of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") as of fall 2017. She is also a principal investigator at The Methodology Center, at [Penn State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University "Pennsylvania State University").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-5)

> She is developing "new methodologies to evaluate courses of treatment for individuals coping with chronic or relapsing disorders ... Murphy’s Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) is a means for learning how best to dynamically adapt treatment to each individual’s response over time. Using SMART, clinicians assess and modify patients’ treatments during the trial, an approach with potential applications in the treatment of a range of chronic diseases—such as ADHD, alcoholism, drug addiction, HIV/AIDS, and cardiovascular disease—that involve [therapies that are regularly reconsidered and replaced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_treatment_regime "Dynamic treatment regime") as the disease progresses.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Murphy#cite_note-macfound-2)

Murphy is a Professor of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") and a Professor of Computer Science at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. She is also affiliated with Harvard's [Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_Institute_for_Advanced_Study "Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study") as a Radcliffe Alumnae Professor.

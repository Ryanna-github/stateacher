# Biography[English]

Welcome! I am a Professor in the Dept. of Statistics, Harvard University. I was born and brought up in Kerala, India. I obtained my Bachelors from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, Chennai. After that, I went to graduate school at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA, and obtained my Ph.D. in statistics in 2008. After Duke, I was a Post Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Research in Statistical Methodology (CRiSM), University of Warwick, UK, during 2008-10.

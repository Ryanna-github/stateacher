# Biography[English]

**Carl Neracher Morris** is a professor in the Statistics Department of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") and spent several years as a researcher for the [RAND Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Corporation "RAND Corporation") working on the [RAND Health Insurance Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_Health_Insurance_Experiment "RAND Health Insurance Experiment").

Carl Morris had received his BS in Aeronautical Engineering from the [California Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology "California Institute of Technology") in 1960 and then attended [Indiana University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_University "Indiana University") until 1962. He obtained his Ph.D. in [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") from [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") under advisor [Charles Stein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stein_(statistician) "Charles Stein (statistician)") in 1966.

Since 1990, Morris has been at Harvard Statistics Department and [Harvard Medical School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School "Harvard Medical School") Department of Health Care Policy. He served as the chair of the Harvard Statistics Department from 1994 to 2000.

Morris has also been a professor at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Cruz "University of California, Santa Cruz"), [Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_S._Pardee_RAND_Graduate_School "Frederick S. Pardee RAND Graduate School"), Stanford University, and the [University of Texas at Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin "University of Texas at Austin") where he served as Director of the Center for Statistical Sciences.

Morris is a Fellow of the [American Statistical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Statistical_Association "American Statistical Association"), [Institute of Mathematical Statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Mathematical_Statistics "Institute of Mathematical Statistics"), and [Royal Statistical Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Statistical_Society "Royal Statistical Society"), and an elected member of ISI. Morris was an editor of both the _Theory and Methods_, the _[Journal of the American Statistical Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_American_Statistical_Association "Journal of the American Statistical Association")_ (1983–1985) and _[Statistical Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Science "Statistical Science")_ (1989–1991).

Morris is best known for his work on [natural exponential families](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_exponential_family "Natural exponential family") with quadratic [variance functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance_function "Variance function") (NEF-QVF), a theory which classifies the most common statistical distributions. Morris is also well known for his work in sports statistics.

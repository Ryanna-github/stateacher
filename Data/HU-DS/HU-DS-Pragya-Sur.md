# Profile

![Pragya Sur](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~prs499/Pragya_Headshot.jpg)

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Statistics Department at Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). My research broadly spans high-dimensional statistics, statistical machine learning, robust inference and prediction under multi-study settings, and algorithmic fairness. I am simultaneously interested in applications of large scale statistical methods to computational neuroscience and genetics. I am currently supported by a William F. Milton Fund and NSF DMS #2113426.

Prior to this, I spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Research on Computation and Society](https://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), hosted by [Prof. Cynthia Dwork](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-us/directory?search=%22Cynthia%20Dwork%22). I received a Ph.D. in Statistics in 2019 from [Stanford University](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/), advised by [Prof. Emmanuel Candès](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/). At Stanford, I was honored to receive a [Ric Weiland Graduate Fellowship](https://humsci.stanford.edu/current-students/fellowships-and-funding) and the [Theodore W. Anderson Theory of Statistics Dissertation Award](https://statistics.stanford.edu/news/2019-statistics-department-dissertation-awards). I completed a Bachelor of Statistics in 2012 and a Master of Statistics in 2014 from the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](http://www.isical.ac.in/). Here are links to my [CV](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~prs499/cv_august_2021.pdf), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=woJuzsUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile, and [Math Genealogy](https://www.mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=255377).

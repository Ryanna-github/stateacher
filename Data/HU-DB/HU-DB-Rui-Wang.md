# Biography[English]

Dr. Wang’s research interests include the design, monitoring, and analysis of parallel and stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials, where a group of subjects, as opposed to individuals, are randomized to each of the treatment arms in the trial. The particular questions she is addressing include the investigation of how the complex correlation structure within clusters affects the sample size and power of the trial, and how to analyze data from such trials efficiently, taking into account the correlation structure and the issue of missing data. She has also been developing improved statistical techniques for a cross-sectional approach that, when combined with modern HIV screening methods, can substantially reduce the cost and increase the accuracy of HIV incidence estimation. Her research interests also include longitudinal modeling of non-linear trajectories and model selection, as well as addressing missing data issues in distributed data networks.

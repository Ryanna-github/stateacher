# Biography[English]

Francesca Dominici, PhD is the co-Director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative, at the Harvard University and the Clarence James Gamble Professor of Biostatistics, Population and Data Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and of the International Society of Mathematical Statistics. She is an expert in causal inference, machine learning, Bayesian statistics. She leads an interdisciplinary group of scientists with the ultimate goal of addressing important questions in environmental health science, climate change, and biomedical science. Her productivity and contributions to the field have been remarkable. Dominici has provided the scientific community and policy makers with robust evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollution, noise pollution, and climate change. Her studies have directly and routinely impacted air quality policy. Dominici has published more than 220 peer-reviewed publications and was recognized in Thomson Reuter’s 2019 list of the most highly cited researchers–ranking in the top 1% of cited scientists in her field. Her work has been covered by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, BBC, the Guardian, CNN, and NPR. In April 2020 she has been awarded the Karl E. Peace Award for Outstanding Statistical Contributions for the Betterment of Society by the American Statistical Association. Dominici is an advocate for the career advancement of women faculty. Her work on the Johns Hopkins University Committee on the Status of Women earned her the campus Diversity Recognition Award in 2009. At the T.H. Chan School of Public
Health, she has led the Committee for the Advancement of Women Faculty.

In her current role as co-director of the Data Science Initiative at Harvard University Dr. Dominici is building on the collaborations that already exist across the University to foster a rich and cohesive data science community, bringing together scholars from across disciplines and schools. In addition to carrying out the academic plan of the initiative, she oversees the operations and distribution of seed funding and helps to raise funds to support its key programmatic activities.

In her past role as Senior Associate Dean for Research, Dr. Dominici led advancements to optimize the health of the Harvard Chan School’s research enterprise. She oversaw the School’s Office of Research Strategy and Development (ORSD) and led ORSD’s flagship faculty grant-writing short course. In addition to her own extensive research program, as Senior Associate Dean for Research, Dr. Dominici provided scientific leadership in the submission of numerous proposals designed to advance the School’s and University’s scientific innovation.

In her role as Associate Dean of Information Technology, Dr. Dominici led new initiatives to improve the research computing infrastructure at the Harvard Chan School. Dr. Dominici worked closely with the senior leadership at the School of Public Health and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) to execute a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to allow Chan School faculty, researchers, staff, and students to access the FAS Research Computing environment (Odyssey). Odyssey is Harvard’s largest supercomputer, spanning three data centers for a total of 9,641 square feet dedicated to compute. Access to this state-of-the-art computing cluster has transformed the research computing landscape at the Chan School, positioning the School at the forefront of the Big Data revolution and allowing Chan School faculty to pursue Big Data driven research that is pushing the frontiers of science.

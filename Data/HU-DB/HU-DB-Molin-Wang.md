# Biography[English]

As a faculty member with joint appointments in both Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Dr. Wang’s current methodological  researches focus on statistical challenges encountered in epidemiological studies, including assessment of timing of effect in survival analysis, evaluation of etiological disease heterogeneity, methods for pooling biomarker data, and measurement error and missing data problems. She has also developed semi-parametric methods for reducing the impact of nuisance parameters.

She is the lead statistician for the Pooling Project on Diet and Cancer in Women and Men, the Vitamin D and Breast Cancer/Colorectal Cancer Consortium, and several HIV studies conducted in Uganda and Tanzania. She has also been the lead statistician for the Nurses’ Health Study II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the lead statistician for several projects based on the Harvard cohorts. She has been actively working on analyses, providing input into the development of analytic procedures and their interpretation, and overseeing software development for the routine implementation of advanced and novel statistical methods.

Before October 2010, she had worked on statistical collaborations in various oncology projects with Harvard – Dana Farber Cancer Institute biomedical investigators and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), with a focus on the design and analysis of breast cancer clinical trials.

# Biography[English]

Dr. Fitzmaurice has research interests in a number of areas, including methods for analysing discrete longitudinal data, models for mixed discrete and continuous outcomes, general missing data problems, methods for detecting and adjusting for overdispersion, and statistical problems in psychiatric epidemiology and mental health research.

A major focus of his research is on the development of statistical methodology for analysing discrete multivariate data. In particular, he has developed likelihood-based methods for analysing multivariate binary data arising from longitudinal studies. In addition, he has developed methods for handling non-ignorable dropouts in longitudinal clinical trials. Dr. Fitzmaurice has also conducted research on methods for simultaneously analysing mixed discrete and continuous outcomes. Recently, he has begun developing methods for analyzing complex sample surveys.

Dr. Fitzmaurice’s research in psychiatric epidemiology has concentrated on methodological problems surrounding the use of multiple informant data in mental health surveys.

Much of Dr. Fitzmaurice’s more recent collaborative research has concentrated on applications to mental health research, broadly defined.

With colleagues Nan Laird and Jim Ware, Dr. Fitzmaurice published a bestselling textbook on Applied Longitudinal Analysis in 2004; the 2nd edition of this book was published August 2011.

With colleagues Marie Davidian, Geert Verbeke and Geert Molenberghs, Dr. Fitzmaurice has published an edited book on Longitudinal Data Analysis.

With colleagues Geert Molenberghs, Mike Kenward, Geert Verbeke and Butch Tsiatis, Dr. Fitzmaurice has recently completed an edited book: Handbook of Missing Data.

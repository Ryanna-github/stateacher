# Biography[English]

My research involves two interrelated research themes. In statistical network science, the study of network representations of physical, biological, and social phenomena, we develop quantitative methods for studying social and biological networks and their connection to health. In digital phenotyping, a concept we have introduced as “the moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in situ using data from personal digital devices, in particular smartphones,” we develop quantitative methods for studying social, behavioral, and cognitive phenotypes. Our focus in both statistical network science and digital phenotyping is development of new statistical and quantitative methods, but we also co-lead or support several applied studies ranging from central nervous system disorders to women’s health. My group has developed and maintains the open source Beiwe research platform for high-throughput smartphone-based digital phenotyping. Please see the lab’s webpage for more details.

# Education[English]

I joined the Department of Biostatistics in 2011. I was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Medical School, a Fulbright Scholar at the Harvard Kennedy School, and a Junior Research Fellow at the University of Oxford. I obtained my doctorate at the Helsinki University of Technology (now Aalto University) in 2006, where my dissertation received the Dissertation of the Year Award from the university. I received NIH Director’s New Innovator Award in 2013 for the Digital Phenotyping project.

# Profile

![Jeffrey Miller](https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/profile/Modules/CustomViewPersonGeneralInfo/PhotoHandler.ashx?NodeID=66242056)

# Biography[English]

The goal of my research is to develop statistical methods to help understand diseases of aging at the cellular/molecular level. I am interested in using high-throughput genomic data to develop mathematical models of the key biological processes and molecular mechanisms that underlie age-related decline in general, and cancer in particular. In addition to advancing our scientific understanding, this will enable the development of accurate prognostic and diagnostic tools for precision medicine.

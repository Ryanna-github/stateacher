# Profile

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The aim of my research is to develop statistical methods that enable maximally rigorous and impactful uses of data to answer environmental health questions. In particular, my recent work centers on (1) methods for estimation of the health impacts of complex environmental regulations and quasi-experiments and (2) methods for studying the impacts of climate, heat, and natural disasters on health and predicting the health impacts of future extreme climate events.
 
My methodological research interests include causal inference, machine learning, Bayesian methods, latent variable models, spatial statistics, and time series analysis. I have applied these methods to investigate scientific questions not only in environmental health contexts but also in reproductive epidemiology, neuroimaging, social science, and cell biology.

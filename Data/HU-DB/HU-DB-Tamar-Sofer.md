# Biography[English]

I am a biostatistician studying genetics and ‘omics determinants and signatures of sleep, cognitive decline, and related phenotypes. I develop statistical and computational approaches for assessing genetic associations in challenging scenarios, especially when the target population is diverse: genetically, and in other ways. Recently I’ve been extending my research program into ‘omics (DNA methylation, gene expression, metabolomics, etc.). I strongly believe that statistical methods should be developed and applied to address specific scientific questions, and good application of statistics comes when one is immersed in the scientific research. Therefore, I am always eager to collaborate and work as an integral part of the scientific team.

My journey in Biostatistical research began in my doctoral studies, when I worked on variable selection, a set of statistical analyses approaches to find which are important variables out of a set of potential variables (for example, which genotypes are associated with BMI, when you have many candidate genotypes?). At that time, I also worked a lot on applications in the field of environmental health, where I was trying to develop useful statistical methods to answer questions such as “how various air pollution measures influence DNA methylation?"

Later, during my postdoc, I developed and applied semi-parametric and causal-inference methods to estimate effects in observational studies, that account and correct for various biases such as selection bias, occurring when one the actual population observed in a study is not the “general population”, but rather a subset that stayed on, or was selected for, a specific treatment of interest.

Between 2014 and 2017 I was a research scientist at a group called “Genetic Analysis Center”, at the University of Washington. I spent a lot of time working on the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, a longitudinal study that follows a population of Hispanics/Latinos. I became fascinated with this population, which is very diverse, both environmentally and genetically. I developed and applied various statistical methods inspired by this study, and I am still interested in studying diverse and underserved populations, where I believe public health research has much to contribute.

Currenly I am focusing my research on sleep and related traits, and combining all my passions together for that, as sleep is affect by environmental exposures, genetics architecture, and is associated with other molecular markers.

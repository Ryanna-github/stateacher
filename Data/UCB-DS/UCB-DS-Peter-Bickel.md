# Biography[English]

Peter Bickel's research spans a number of areas. In his work on semiparametric models (he is a co-author of the recent book Efficient and Adaptive Estimation for Semiparametric Models), he uses asymptotic theory to guide development and assessment of such models. His studies of hidden Markov models, which are important in such diverse fields as speech recognition and molecular biology, are directed toward understanding how well the method of maximum likelihood performs. He is also interested in the bootstrap, in particular in constructing diagnostic measures to detect malfunction of this technique. Recently he has become involved in developing empirical statistical models for genomic sequences. He is a co-author of the well known book Mathematical Statistics: Basic Ideas and Selected Topics. He is past President of the Bernoulli Society and of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, a MacArthur Fellow, and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Sciences.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My main theoretical interest is in understanding why we are able to do statistics as well as we do on very high dimensional datasets without knowing much, even though least favorable (malicious God) formulations suggest we should not be able to do anything. Currently this has led me to focus on estimation of covariance matrices and their eigenstructures in high dimensions. Parallel applied interests are in:

 Computational biology, specifically at the moment regulatory networks in the cell. To my surprise some of the methods flowing out of my primary interest are relevant to this one.
 Atmospheric sciences ... in part as a ready source of questions based on very high dimensional data.

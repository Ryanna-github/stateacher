# Profile

![Peng Ding](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/crop_person/public/faculty/pengding.jpg?h=29e7d5b2&itok=PQpt6eJn)

# Biography[English]

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Statistics, Harvard University in May 2015, and worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Epidemiology, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health until December 2015. Previously, I received my B.S. (Mathematics), B.A. (Economics), and M.S. (Statistics) from Peking University.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My main research interest is causal inference including: 

Design and analysis of randomized experiments: randomization tests, covariate adjustment, rerandomization, clustered experiments

Observational studies: sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding, overlap of covariates, integrating multiple data sources

Natural experiments: instrumental variable, difference-in-difference, regression discontinuity

Causal mechanisms: treatment effect variation, principal stratification, mediation, interference

I am also fascinated by survey sampling, missing data, and measurement error problems. 

For applied statistics, I have a broad interest in social sciences and biomedical studies.

# Biography[English]

I am an assistant professor in the Berkeley Statistics Department.

In Fall 2021 I will teach Stat 210A, Theoretical Statistics. If you are an undergraduate who wants to take the course, please fill out the permission code request form to let me know about your background. Please note that the enrollment in Fall 2021 will be less than usual; it is possible a few undergrads will be able to take the course but I cannot promise anything.

In addition, I am running an undergraduate research mentorship program. We are seeking undergraduate researchers and PhD and postdoc mentors for Fall 2021; see more information at the link.

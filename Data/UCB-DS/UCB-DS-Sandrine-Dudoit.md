# Biography[English]

Sandrine Dudoit is Professor and Chair of the Department of Statistics and Professor in the Division of Biostatistics, School of Public, at the University of
California, Berkeley. Professor Dudoit's methodological research interests regard high-dimensional inference and include exploratory data analysis (EDA),
visualization, loss-based estimation with cross-validation (e.g., density estimation, classification, regression, model selection), and multiple hypothesis testing. Much of her methodological work is motivated by statistical inference questions arising in biological research and, in particular, the design and analysis
of high-throughput microarray and sequencing gene expression experiments, e.g., single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) for discovering novel cell types and for the study of stem cell differentiation. Her contributions include: exploratory data analysis, normalization and expression quantitation, differential
expression analysis, class discovery, prediction, inference of cell lineages,integration of biological annotation metadata (e.g., Gene Ontology (GO)
annotation). She is also interested in statistical computing and, in particular,reproducible research. She is a founding core developer of the Bioconductor Project (http://www.bioconductor.org), an open-source and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and genomic data.
Professor Dudoit is a co-author of the book Multiple Testing Procedures with Applications to Genomics and a co-editor of the book Bioinformatics and
Computational Biology Solutions Using R and Bioconductor. She is Associate Editor of three journals, including The Annals of Applied Statistics and IEEE/ACM
Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics. Professor Dudoit was named Fellow of the American Statistical Association in 2010, Elected Member of
the International Statistical Institute in 2014, and Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 2021.
Professor Dudoit obtained a Bachelor's degree (1992) and a Master's degree (1994) in Mathematics from Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada. She first came to UC Berkeley as a graduate student and earned a PhD degree in 1999 from the Department of Statistics. Her doctoral research, under the supervision of Professor Terence P. Speed, concerned the linkage analysis of complex human traits. From 1999 to 2000, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley. Before joining the Faculty at UC Berkeley in July 2001, she underwent two years of postdoctoral training in genomics in the laboratory of Professor Patrick O. Brown, Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University. Her work in the Brown Lab involved the development and application of statistical methods and software for the analysis of microarray gene expression data.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My research and teaching activities concern the development and application of statistical and computational methods to address problems in biomedical and genomic research. The statistical inference questions are truly multivariate and involve the joint analysis of multiple, diverse, and high-dimensional datasets. High-throughput assays such as microarrays and next-generation sequencers allow biologists to monitor expression levels for entire genomes. A challenging task is to relate these genome-wide genotypes to biological and clinical covariates (e.g., age, sex, environmental exposure) and outcomes (e.g., cell type/state, affectedness/unaffectedness, survival time, response to treatment) as well as to the wealth of biological annotation metadata available on the web (e.g. Gene Ontology, KEGG pathways, PubMed literature).

Motivated by these biological challenges, my methodological research interests fall in the following two areas: loss-based estimation with cross-validation (parametric and non-parametric density estimation and regression, variable selection) and resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing. I am also interested in statistical computing and I am a core developer of the Bioconductor Project, an open-source and open-development software project for the analysis of biomedical and genomic data.

Martin Wainwright is currently a professor at University of California at Berkeley, with a joint appointment between the Department of Statistics and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). He received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from University of Waterloo, Canada, and Ph.D. degree in EECS from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His research interests include high-dimensional statistics, information theory, statistical machine learning, and optimization theory. He has been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship (2005), Best Paper Awards from the IEEE Signal Processing Society (2008), and IEEE Communications Society (2010); the Joint Paper Prize (2012) from IEEE Information Theory and Communication Societies; a Medallion Lectureship (2013) from the Institute of Mathematical Statistics; a Section Lecturer at the International Congress of Mathematicians (2014); and the COPSS Presidents' Award (2014) from the Joint Statistical Societies.

# Profile

![Song Mei](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/styles/crop_person/public/faculty/songmei_new.jpg?h=6f2bab55&itok=SxNxuRJ9)

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley. In June 2020, I received my Ph. D. from Stanford, where I was advised by Andrea Montanari.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My research is motivated by data science, and lies at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, information theory, and computer science. I often build on insights that originated within the statistical physics literature. My current research interests include high dimensional probability, theory of deep learning, and theory of reinforcement learning.

# Biography[English]
Dr. Zhang is Professor of Statistics and Data Science in The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania.  Her current research focuses primarily on the development of statistical and computational approaches for the analysis of genetic, genomic, and transcriptomic data.  In the field of Genomics, she has developed methods to improve the accuracy of copy number variant and structural variant detection, methods for improved FDR control, and methods for analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data.  In the field of Statistics, she has developed new models and methods for change-point analysis, variable selection, and model selection.  Dr. Zhang has also made contributions in the area of tumor genomics, where she has developed analysis methods to improve our understanding of intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity.

Dr. Zhang obtained her Ph.D. in Statistics in 2005 from Stanford University.  After one year of postdoctoral training at University of California, Berkeley, she returned to the Department of Statistics at Stanford University as Assistant Professor in 2006.  She received the Sloan Fellowship in 2011, before formally moving to University of Pennsylvania in 2012 as tenured Associate Professor.  She is the Principal Investigator in multiple independent research awards funded by the National institutes of Health and National Science Foundation.  She was rewarded a Medallion Lectureship by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics in 2021.  At Penn, she is a member of the Graduate Group in Genomics and Computational Biology and of the Penn Neurodegeneration Genomics Center.

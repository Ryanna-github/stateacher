He holds a BS in mathematics, a MS in actuarial science, and a Ph.D. in applied mathematics, all obtained at the Free University of Brussels. He joined the Wharton School in 1987 as Director of the Actuarial Science Program.

Jean Lemaire has published over 100 research papers and books in game theory and actuarial science. He has lectured on insurance regulation and actuarial science in over 60 countries. His 1985 book “Automobile Insurance: Actuarial Models” was the insurance book-of-the-year both in Europe and in the US. His books have been translated in French, Spanish, Mandarin, Russian, Japanese, and Korean.

In 2008 he was elected Honorary Chairman of ASTIN, the non-life section of the International Actuarial Association, and received the Wharton School’s Hauck Award for excellence in teaching.

# Profile

![Aaditya Ramdas](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/ramdas.png)

# Biography[English]
I am motivated by broad practical issues in the application of statistics, data science, ML and AI to solve problems in science and technology, that I attempt to address using a theory-backed methodology lens. Most of my [published work](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/pubs-topic.html) appears in the top proceedings in ML/AI (NeurIPS, ICML, COLT, ALT, AISTATS, UAI, AAAI, IJCAI, etc) and the top journals in statistics (AoS, AoAS, Biometrika, JRSSB, EJS, JCGS, PNAS, etc), with several one-off papers in the top IEEE, SIAM and probability journals.
Aaditya Ramdas is an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University, in the Departments of Statistics and Machine Learning. He was one of the inaugural inductees of the [COPSS Leadership Academy](https://imstat.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Bulletin50_3.pdf), and a recipient of the [Bernoulli New Researcher Award](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/news/2021/ramdas-honored-bernoulli-society-new-researcher-award). His work is supported by an [NSF CAREER Award](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2020/january/award-ramdas.html), an Adobe Faculty Research Award, an ARL Grant on Safe Reinforcement Learning, the [Block Center Grant for Technology and Society](https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/center-faculty/index.html), amongst several others.

Aaditya's main theoretical and methodological research interests include **selective and simultaneous inference** (interactive, structured, post-hoc control of false decision rates, etc), **sequential uncertainty quantification** (confidence sequences, always-valid p-values, bias in bandits, etc), and **distribution-free black-box predictive inference** (conformal prediction, calibration, etc). His areas of applied interest include neuroscience, genetics and voting.

He is one of the organizers of the amazing and diverse [StatML Group](http://statml.cs.cmu.edu/people.html) at CMU.

Outside of work, here are some easy topics for conversation: travel/outdoors (hiking, scuba, etc.), [trash-free living](http://0plastic1year2cents.blogspot.com/2017/01/reflections.html), [completing the Ironman triathlon](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/docs/Ironman.pdf) and [long-distance bicycle rides](http://545miles7days2pedals.blogspot.com/2016/08/thoughts-from-alc-2016.html).

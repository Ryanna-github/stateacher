# Biography[English]
Robin leads efforts with CSAFE to improve forensic proficiency testing programs, including the development and evaluation of testing programs with increased ecological validity. For this work, she has partnered with the Office of the Medical Examiner in Allegheny County and developed relationships with the Houston Forensic Science Center, and she will be working to expand outreach to additional laboratories in the coming year. Additionally, she supports programs to assess and improve statistics training in forensics programs, including developing educational material that ties core statistical concepts to the applications future forensic practitioners will see in practice. Robin brings a range of experience to CSAFE that support statistical communication and education. Prior to returning to school in her late 30s to earn a PhD in biostatistics at UC Berkeley, she worked as a science journalist, and was the first reporter to cover challenges to the forensic use of comparative analysis of bullet lead (for the LA Times in in 2003), a technique that has since been discontinued. Her 2005 CNN documentary “Reasonable Doubt,” which covered additional challenges in forensic science, won the Livingston Award. At Carnegie Mellon University, Robin teaches applied regression and survey design and analysis, and she directs the program in Statistics and Human Rights at the CMU Center for Human Rights Science, which includes work with prison oversight groups to develop metrics for evaluating jail and prison facilities. Mejia is co-chair of the Committee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights for the American Statistical Association

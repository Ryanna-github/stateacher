# Profile

![Ann Lee](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/Ann_Lee_Headshot.jpg)

# Biography[English]
I am a professor in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, with a joint appointment in the [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). Prior to joining CMU in 2005, I was the J.W. Gibbs Assistant Professor in the department of mathematics at Yale University, and before that I served a year as a visiting research associate at the department of applied mathematics at Brown University.

My research interests are in developing statistical methodology for complex data and problems in the physical sciences. I am particularly interested in statistical methods that adapt to nonlinear sparse structure in high-dimensional data, and nonparametric approaches that can handle heterogeneous data from different scientific probes. My recent work includes uncertainty quantification via conditional density estimation, likelihood-free inference, validation of emulator models, and applications in astronomy and hurricane intensity guidance involving satellite imagery and massive astronomical surveys.

In 2018, I started the [STAtistical Methods for Physical Sciences (STAMPS)](http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps) research group together with [Mikael Kuusela](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~mkuusela/). STAMPS is hosting public colloquia-style [webinars](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/stamps/webinar/spring-2021/) open to all members of the scientific community, in addition to weekly research group meetings for students and faculty at CMU and UPitt. I am also key personnel in the recently founded [NSF AI Planning Institute for Data-Driven Discovery in Physics](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-physics-institute/).

🚩 **Upcoming!** Our NSF AI Planning Institute at CMU is organizing the virtual workshop [“From Quarks to Cosmos with AI”](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-physics-institute/images/events/2021-7-12_quarks-to-cosmos/quarks-to-cosmos-poster.pdf). The workshop will take place during the week of July 12-16, 2021, and is organized around hackathon-type data challenges relevant to high-energy physics, astrophysics and AI/ML methodology in physics The workshop will also include daily talks by a stellar lineup of speakers. Attendance is free and open to anyone with relevant research interests. For details with a link to the registration page, go to our [conference website](https://events.mcs.cmu.edu/qtc2021/). (Organizers: Tiziana Di Matteo, Mikael Kuusela, Ann Lee, Rachel Mandelbaum, Manfred Paulini)

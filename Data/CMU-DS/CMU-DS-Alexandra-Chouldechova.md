# Biography[English]
Alexandra is an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Public Policy in the H. John Heinz III College at Carnegie Mellon University. She received her B.Sc. from the University of Toronto in 2009, and in 2014, completed her Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University. While at Stanford, she also worked at Google and Symantec on developing statistical assessment methods for information retrieval systems.
Alexandra's main research interests are in high dimensional statistics and large scale hypothesis testing. She is particularly interested in estimation and statistical inference in settings where the data is spatially or temporally structured. Her current research focuses on developing inferential procedures for anomaly detection problems in cases where multiple anomalies are expected to occur. Alexandra is also actively looking for ways to take advantage of modern statistical methods in social science applications.

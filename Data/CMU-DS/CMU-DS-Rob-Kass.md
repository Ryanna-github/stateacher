# Profile

![Rob Kass](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/kass.png)

# Biography[English]
Robert E. (Rob) Kass received his Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Chicago in 1980. His early work formed the basis for his book _Geometrical Foundations of Asymptotic Inference_, co-authored with Paul Vos. His subsequent research has been in Bayesian inference and, beginning in 2000, in the application of statistics to neuroscience. Kass is known not only for his methodological contributions, but also for several major review articles, including one with Adrian Raftery on Bayes factors (_Journal of American Statistical Association_, 1995) one with Larry Wasserman on prior distributions (_Journal of American Statistical Association_, 1996), a pair with Emery Brown on statistics in neuroscience (_Nature Neuroscience_, 2004, also with Partha Mitra; _Journal of Neurophysiology_, 2005, also with Valerie Ventura), and, with 24 others, an overview of computational neuroscience emphasizing essential mathematical and statistical ideas (_Annual Reviews of Statistics and its Applications_, 2018). His book _Analysis of Neural Data_, with Emery Brown and Uri Eden, was published in 2014.

  
Kass has served as Chair of the Section for Bayesian Statistical Science of the American Statistical Association, Chair of the Statistics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, founding Editor-in-Chief of the journal _Bayesian Analysis_, and Executive Editor (editor-in-chief) of the international review journal _Statistical Science_. He is an elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has been recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information as one of the 10 most highly cited researchers, 1995-2005, in the category of mathematics (ranked #4). In 2013 he received the Outstanding Statistical Application Award from the American Statistical Association for his 2011 paper in the _Annals of Applied Statistics_ with Ryan Kelly and Wei-Liem Loh. With various co-authors, Kass has also written on statistics education and the use of statistics, including the short article [_Ten Simple Rules for Effective Statistical Practice,_](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004961) which received more than 100,000 views during the first 10 weeks after it was published. In 1991 he began the series of eight international workshops _Case Studies in Bayesian Statistics_, which were held every two years at Carnegie Mellon, and was co-editor of the six proceedings volumes that were published by Springer. He also founded and co-organized the eight international workshops _Statistical Analysis of Neuronal Data_, from 2002 to 2017. The ninth iteration (with new organizers) took place in the Spring of 2019.

  
Kass received the 2017 R.A. Fisher Award and Lectureship from the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies. The lecture may be found [here (starting at 25:15 in the video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_KV1ONiLE4) and a shorter version, edited to remove most of the technical material, may be found [here](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2017/november/brain-research-underserved-by-statistics.html) with the corresponding CMU press release summary [here.](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2017/november/brain-research-underserved-by-statistics.html) A 2017 interview of Kass in _Statistical Science_ (published in 2019) may be found [here.](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/statsci.html)

  
Kass has been been on the faculty of the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon since 1981; he joined the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC, run jointly by CMU and the University of Pittsburgh) in 1997, and the Machine Learning Department (in the School of Computer Science) in 2007. He served as Department Head of Statistics from 1995 to 2004 and Interim Co-Director of the CNBC (CMU-side director) 2015-2018. He became the Maurice Falk Professor of Statistics and Computational Neuroscience in 2016 (see announcement [here](http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/news/news-stories/2016/august/rob-kass.html)).

  
Kass has provided a brief summary of his work in [5 sentences and 4 questions.](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/papers/#THOUGHTS) Some additional detail on Kass's research may be obtained from his [NIH bio.](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/vita/NIH-Bio.pdf)

More than 80% of Kass's neuroscience publications have involved spike trains. That work is summarized [here.](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/contrib.html)

Videos on many subjects can be found [here.](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kass/videos.html)

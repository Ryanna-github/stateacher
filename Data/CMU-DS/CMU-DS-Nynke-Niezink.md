# Profile

![Nynke Niezink](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/niezink.png)

# Biography[English]
I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics and Data Science](http://stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on the development of statistical methods for analyzing social science data. In particular, I am interested in question related to questions related to statistical network analysis, including how to model social influence processes and how to learn about social behavior based on large-scale relational event data. Other interests include the development of statistical tools for digital humanities and digital democracy.

I closely collaborate with researchers in sociology, education, health sciences, criminology, management, organizations and public policy. I have a courtesy appointment in the [Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/), and work in collaboration with the [Gender, Relationships, and Health Lab](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/gender-relationships-health/) and am part of the [Digital Vaccine Project](https://www.cmu.edu/heinz/digital-vaccine-project/) at CMU.

I coordinate the Networkshop Research Group at CMU. The group’s interests span a range of contemporary topics in statistical network analysis such as graphons, irregularly sampled networks, temporally evolving networks, and various applications. We meet weekly to discuss new problems and results in the literature as well as to share our own research findings.

For publications, see my [CV](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~nynke/Niezink-CV-online.pdf).

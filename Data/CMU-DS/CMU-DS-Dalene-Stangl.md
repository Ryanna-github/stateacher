# Biography[English]
Dalene Kay Stangl is an American statistician known for development and promotion of Bayesian statistical methods in health-related research.

Dalene is Emeritus in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](http://stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, she spent 25 years at Duke University serving as Director of the Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences and as Associate Chair and Director of Undergraduate Studies. She has held editorships for _Journal of the American Statistical Association_, _The American Statistician_, _Bayesian Analysis_, and _Chance_. She also co-edited two books, **Bayesian Biostatistics** and **Meta-Analysis in Medicine and Health Policy**. She has won numerous awards including ASA’s Youden Award for her research paper _“Prediction and Decision Making Using Bayesian Hierarchical Models,”_ ASA Fellow for leadership in statistical education, outstanding contributions to research in health-related areas, and service to the profession, and Duke’s Trinity College Distinguished Teaching Award. She served two terms as chair of the ASA’s Committee on Women in Statistics, launching the first [Conference for Women in Statistics](https://women-in-stats.org/) in 2014. Her MOOC, [_Teaching Statistical Thinking_](https://www.coursera.org/course/teachstats1), was offered on Coursera starting in October of 2014. In 2019 she was awarded an ASA Founders’ Award.

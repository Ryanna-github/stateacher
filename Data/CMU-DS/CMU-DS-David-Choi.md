# Profile

![David Choi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/DaveChoi.png)

# Biography[English]
David is an assistant professor of Statistics and Information Systems at Heinz college.

He has previously worked as a research scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and was a visiting scholar in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley. He was a graduate student at the Information Systems Laboratory in the department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University under the advisement of Benjamin Van Roy. He received the PhD from Stanford University in 2004.

I'm an assistant professor in Heinz College, which is part of Carnegie Mellon University, and contains the Schools of Public Policy and Information Systems. I also have a courtesy appointment in the Department of Statistics.

My research interests are statistics and machine learning in network settings. This includes community detection, other network models involving latent variables or unsupervised learning, and causal inference in the presence of social network effects (i.e., interference between units).

I was a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, where my advisor was Benjamin Van Roy. I've also worked as a technical staff member at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, as a postdoc in the School of Engineering at Harvard University, and as a visiting postdoc in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley.

# Interests[English]
Statistics and machine learning for social networks and other network data:

1. Stochastic blockmodels, other network models with latent variables or unsupervised learning
2. Causal inference under interference
3. Application to social and other networks

Dissertation: _Optimization for Value Function Approximation_

Advisor: Benjamin Van Roy

# Biography[English]
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics and Data Science, as well as affiliated faculty in the Machine Learning Department. Prior to joining the department in 2014, I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistics from Stanford University under the supervision of Robert Tibshirani. Before that I received my B.S. in Physics and Applied Math at the California Institute of Technology in 2009.

Dr. G'Sell is an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as affiliated faculty in the Machine Learning Department. His research broadly focuses on questions at the interface of statistical inference and machine learning, with a particular interest in applications to complex problems in the sciences and beyond. His work is supported through funding from organizations including the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Simons Foundation, as well as support for computing from the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center and the NSF XSEDE program.

Dr. G'Sell received a PhD in Statistics from Stanford University, where he was advised by Robert Tibshirani, and a B.S. in Physics and Applied and Computational Mathematics from the California Institute of Technology.

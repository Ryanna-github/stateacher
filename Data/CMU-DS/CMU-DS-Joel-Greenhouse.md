# Profile

![Joel Greenhouse](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/Joel_Greenhouse3.png)

# Biography[English]
_I earned my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan, after which I came to the Department of Statistics at Carnegie Mellon University as a post-doctoral fellow._

I have been on the faculty in the Department of Statistics & Data Science since 1983. I served as Associate Dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1997-2002. I am also an Adjunct Professor of Epidemiology and Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh.

I have served on data and safety monitoring boards and scientific advisory committees for a number of National Institutes of Health and Veterans Administration studies. I have served on several National Academy of Sciences’ committees, including the _Committee on National Statistics_, the Panel on _Combining Information_, and the Institute of Medicine’s _Committee on the Assessment of Family Violence Interventions_. Recently I co-chaired the _Panel Study on the Review of the Compliance, Safety and Accountability Program of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration._

I am a fellow of the American Statistical Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. My awards include CMU’s Doherty Award for Sustained Contributions to Education, the Ryan Teaching Award for Effectiveness in Teaching Undergraduate Students, and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences' E. Dunlop Smith Award for Distinguished Teaching and Educational Service.

My research interests include the development of statistical methods for the design and analysis of data from observational studies, clinical trials and for meta-analysis. Most recently I have been working on developing methods for combining information from multiple data sources.

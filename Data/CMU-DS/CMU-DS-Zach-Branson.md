# Profile

![Zach Branson](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/Branson-Zach.png)

# Biography[English]
I am an assistant teaching professor in Carnegie Mellon's [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstat.cmu.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGwRRfVcf9P-X_5wZQsUoohO64nLA). My main research interests are:

- **Experimental Design,** especially when there are many non-categorical covariates and/or multiple estimands of interest, as in factorial designs.
    
- **Causal Inference**, especially matching methods for observational studies.
    
- **Rerandomization** techniques for ensuring covariate balance.
    
- **Randomization tests**, for checking assumptions as well as inference.
    
- **Regression discontinuity designs** and other "quasi-experiments."
    
- **Applications** in economics, education, engineering, epidemiology, medicine, political science, and text analysis.
    

Also, see my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lFteQO4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

If you're interested in implementing my Gaussian process approach for regression discontinuity designs, [see here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzjbranson%2FBranson-2019-Regression-Discontinuity-Replication-Files&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHQ8bb5F57D_7q9ifHO_wAuc2Xu9w). If you're interested in assessing covariate balance using my R package randChecks, [see here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16G59khS-HVUjsSYY3NTT3yOq-Y-26la4/view?usp=sharing). More details are on the [software page](https://sites.google.com/site/zjbranson/software-and-replication-files).

I received a PhD in Statistics from Harvard University in 2019. My dissertation committee was [Tirthankar Dasgupta](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdumptydg.wixsite.com%2Fmysite&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNETEmx5OHF1zSVyVVGgMkoEHoDIfw), [Luke Miratrix](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fscholar.harvard.edu%2Flmiratrix%2Fhome&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH3V5-Z4qPWF_XF5sZOvQupORhBig), and [José Zubizarreta](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjrzubizarreta.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEiR_xQ4f6lurMM0MRMsyVzZrRiEw). Before that, I received a B.S. in Economics and Statistics and a B.A. in Professional Writing from Carnegie Mellon University in 2014. I was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, where I received an excellent education from Jefferson County Public Schools. In my spare time I run, [read non-statistics books](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodreads.com%2Fuser%2Fshow%2F34378479-zach-branson&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG7woFYhTzBKDxPACefl5FfybVClw), and play guitar and chess.

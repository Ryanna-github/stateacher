# Biography[English]
I am the John C. Warner Professor of Statistics, Emeritus, with appointments in the Department of Biological Sciences, Machine Learning Department, and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition. Prior to coming to Carnegie Mellon in 1976, I earned an A.B. degree in statistics from Princeton University, and M.A., M.Phil., and Ph.D. degrees in statistics from Yale University.

I am an elected fellow of the American Statistical Association, Institute of Mathematical Statistics, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and an elected member of the International Statistical Institute. I was designated a lifetime National Associate by the National Academy of Sciences. When I completed my second three-year term as chairman of the Committee on National Statistics in 2010, I became the only person to have chaired both statistics committees at the National Academies, having previously chaired the Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics.

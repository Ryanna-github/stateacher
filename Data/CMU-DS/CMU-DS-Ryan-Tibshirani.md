# Profile

![Ryan Tibshirani](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/Ryan_Tibshirani_headshot.jpg)

# Biography[English]
I am a Professor jointly appointed in the Departments of [Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) and [Machine Learning](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. I joined the Statistics faculty at Carnegie Mellon University in 2011, and I joined the Machine Learning faculty in 2013. I did my Ph.D. in Statistics at Stanford University in 2011. My thesis advisor was [Jonathan Taylor](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jtaylo/). Before that, I did my B.S. in Mathematics at Stanford University in 2007.

### Research Interests

My research interests lie broadly in statistics, machine learning, and optimization. More specifically, my interests include high-dimensional statistics, nonparametric estimation, distribution-free inference, continuous optimization, and numerical analysis. My main applied focus at this time is on [tracking and forecasting epidemics](http://delphi.midas.cs.cmu.edu/) (previously focused on seasonal flu, and now COVID-19).

### Professional Service

I am an Associate Editor for the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://www.jmlr.org/) (JMLR), and on the Editorial Board for the [Springer Series in the Data Sciences](https://www.springer.com/series/13852). I am on the [Scientific Advisory Board](https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/people/science-advisory-board/) the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM).  
  
In the past, I have been an Associate Editor for the Annals of Statistics, Biometrika, Journal of American Statistical Society (JASA), and for a number of ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS).  
  
A full CV can be found [here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/cv.pdf).

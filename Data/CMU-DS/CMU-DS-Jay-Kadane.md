# Profile

![Jay Kadane](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/jay-pic2017.png)

# Biography[English]
I am the Leonard J. Savage Professor of Statistics and Social Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. I have a B.A. in mathematics from Harvard University, and a Ph.D. in statistics from Stanford University. Before coming to Carnegie Mellon University in 1971, I was at Yale and at the Center for Naval Analysis. I served as department head of CMU Statistics 1972--1981. I am an elected fellow of the American Statistical Association, the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the International Society for Bayesian Analysis. I was awarded a Fullbright Fellowship to Chile in 2004. While I became emeritus in 2006, I continue to be active in the department. In 2014, I was awarded the DeGroot Prize for my book, "Principles of Uncertainty."  

My area of study is generally about uncertainty, both in principle, and in applications to a wide variety of subjects. My work on the more theoretical side is summarized in my book "Principles of Uncertainty" (2011, Chapman and Hall, also free on the web). My applied work includes contributions to many fields, including archaeology, physics, marketing, internet security, internet auctions, air pollution, etc.

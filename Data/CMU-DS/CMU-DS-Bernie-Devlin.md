# Profile

![Bernie Devlin](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/faculty_pictures/Devlin.png)

# Biography[English]
I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 1986, after which I had a post-doc appintment at the University of California, Riverside. Since then I worked as a biostatistician and research faculty in the Division of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Medicine (1990-1994), had a visiting appointment in Carnegie Mellon University, Department of Statistics (1995-1996), and have since been a faculty member of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (Psychiatry and Human Genetics). I have been working in the field of human genetics for the past 23 years and in psychiatric genetics for the past 15 years.  
My research has two major foci: the development or refinement of statistical methods for the analysis of genetic data and the implementation of those methods to discover the genetic basis of disease, especially autism, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative disorders. My work has been recognized by admission as a fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Statistics Section.

2\. **Ancestry analysis:** Since the introduction of GC more elegant ways of controlling for population structure have been developed. We contributed to these approaches in fundamental ways by showing how genetic matching can be effective as a design tool and how the connections between multidimensional scaling and spectral graph theory, specifically a spectral embedding derived from the normalized Laplacian of a graph, can produce more meaningful delineation of ancestry than by using Principal Component Analysis.

b. Lee AB, Luca D, Klei L, Devlin B, Roeder K. Discovering genetic ancestry using spectral graph theory. Genetic Epidemiology 34:51-59, 2009. PMID: 19455578  
  

3\. **Cloning a gene affecting head and neck tumors:** Initiated by Dr. Charles Richard, the goal of this project was to find one or more mutations causing paragangliomas (PGL). I took on the project after Dr. Richard accepted a job in industry. With post-doc Bora Baysal, who performed the bulk of the early PGL work for his Ph.D. thesis, and within two years, the gene PGL1 was cloned and those results were reported in Science. The finding was a breakthrough, leading not only to the cloning of other genes for PGL, but also to a deeper understanding of much more common and more lethal pheochromocytomas.

Devilee, B. Devlin, Mutations in SDHD, a Mitochondrial Complex II Gene, in Hereditary Paraganglioma, Science 287:848- 851, 2000.  
  

4\. **Genomic Control:** It has long been known that heterogeneity among populations, both genetically and phenotypically, gives rise to spurious associations between phenotype and genotype. An elegant solution to this confounding is to use family structure to control for heterogeneity. Because of the difficulty of accruing family samples, we developed an alternative that controls for confounding using the properties of the genome. Since the original paper by Devlin and Roeder, Genomic Control or GC is now recognized as a general approach to understand the problem of genotype/phenotype confounding.  
  
a. Devlin B, Roeder K. Genomic control for association studies. Biometrics, 55:997-1004, 1999.  
  

5\. **Scientific basis for "The Bell Curve" and the heritability of IQ:** When Herrnstein and Murray's The Bell Curve appeared in late 1994, a group at Carnegie Mellon University (Bernie Devlin, Stephen Fienberg, Daniel Resnick and Kathryn Roeder) decided to investigate the roots of this controversial bestseller. This research led to an early report to the Carnegie Commission, co-editing a book on the subject ("Intelligence, Genes and Success: Scientists Respond to The Bell Curve"), and a publication in Nature in July of 1997 entitled The Heritability of IQ. It challenged much of the wisdom underlying previous analyses of IQ data by showing that there are other biologically plausible ways of modeling the data. In part, these results also undermined the "scientific" wisdom in The Bell Curve. More importantly our results pointed to prenatal factors as possible predictors of population variation in IQ, something that is gaining wider appreciation as years go by and for a wide array of human phenotypes.  
  
a. Devlin B, Daniels M, Roeder K. The heritability of IQ. Nature 388:468-471, 1997.  
  

6\. **DNA forensics:** In 1990 the use of DNA hypervariable markers for forensic inference was in a precarious position, subject to grave concerns about the validity of its use in the courts. By rigorous statistical modeling of the processes generating these molecular data, a series of 11 papers was produced that highlighted and resolved the issues in this volatile field, virtually all of them appearing in high impact journals such as Science, Journal of the American Statistical Association and The American Journal of Human Genetics.  
  
a. Devlin B, Risch N, Roeder K. Forensic tests and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Science 253:1039-1041, 1991.  
b. Devlin B, Risch N, Roeder K. Forensic inference from DNA fingerprints. Journal of the American Statistical Association 87:337-350, 1992.  
c. Risch N, Devlin B. On the probability of matching DNA fingerprints. Science 255:717-720, 1992.  
d. Devlin B, Risch N, Roeder K. The statistical evaluation of DNA fingerprinting: Critique of the NRC report. Science 259:748-749, 837, 1993.  
  

7\. **Gene flow:** My early work on statistical methods to quantify gene flow was some of most fun I've had in research, in part because it opened up a whole new world for me in terms of collaboration among statisticians (i.e., Bruce Lindsay and Kathryn Roeder) and scientists (Norman Ellstrand). With Bruce and Kathryn we introduced mixture models as a tool for estimating the movement of genes in plant populations, specifically the success of pollen donors, from genetic markers realized from seeds and mature plants (6, 13, 16.) With Norm Ellstrand, my post-doc advisor, we applied these approaches to plant populations.

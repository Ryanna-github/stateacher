# Biography[English]
John Marshall is an Assistant Professor in Residence of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his PhD in biomathematics from UCLA in 2008, writing his dissertation on the use of GM mosquitoes to control malaria transmission. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, he worked on several aspects of this project as a PostDoc – social, cultural and regulatory issues at the UCLA Center for Society & Genetics, ecological fieldwork at the Malaria Research and Training Center in Mali, molecular biology and population genetics at Caltech, and infectious disease modeling and epidemiological fieldwork at Imperial College London. Here at UC Berkeley, he teaches two courses on mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and consults on this field generally. His own research focuses on the use of mathematical models to inform novel genetics-based strategies for mosquito control and to support efforts to control and eliminate mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Zika virus broadly.

# Biography[English]
**Sumanta Basu** is broadly interested in structure learning and prediction of complex, high-dimensional systems arising in biological and social sciences. His current research focuses on network modeling of high-dimensional time series and nonlinear ensemble learning methods.

I am broadly interested in developing statistical machine learning methods for structure learning and prediction of complex, high-dimensional systems arising in biological and social sciences. I am currently working in two areas: (a) network modeling of high-dimensional time series; and (b) detecting high-order interactions in complex biological systems using randomized tree ensembles. I also work closely with scientists and economists on a wide range of problems including prostate cancer progression, large scale metabolomics, and systemic risk monitoring in financial markets.

My research is supported in part by a three-year grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF DMS-1812128), a four-year grant (1R01GM135926-01) from Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support Research at the Interface of the Biological and Mathematical Sciences (DMS/NIGMS), and a two-year grant (1R21NS120227-01) from the National Institute of Health (NIH).

Before joining Cornell, I was a postdoctoral scholar (2014-2016) in the Department of Statistics, UC Berkeley and the Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory . I received my PhD (2014) from the Department of Statistics, University of Michigan , and my bachelors (2006) and masters (2008) in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata . Before joining the PhD program, I worked for a year as a business analyst at Wipro Technologies .

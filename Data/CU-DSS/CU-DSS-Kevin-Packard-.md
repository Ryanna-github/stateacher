# Biography[English]
I'm a lecturer of statistics with 6 years experience teaching introductory statistics and regression analysis courses to undergraduate students. I have served as a statistical consultant at Cornell University and as an academic advisor for the statistics major at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. I love working with undergraduate students who have an interest in statistics and those that are considering careers in statistics related fields.

I'm a creative and detailed-oriented person with a love of the outdoors. I enjoy applications of statistics to ecology and forestry and have had 4 years of experience collecting forest inventory data across the northeastern United States with the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. I'm just as comfortable hiking a mountain to collect data as being in the office developing mathematical models to analyze data. I look forward to continue building a career as a statistician with emphasis on public service.

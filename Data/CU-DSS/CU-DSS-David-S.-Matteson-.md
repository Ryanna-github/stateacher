# Biography[English]
David S. Matteson is Associate Professor of Statistics and Data Science and at Cornell University, where he is a member of the ILR School, Computing and Information Science, the Center for Applied Mathematics, the Field of Operations Research, and the Program in Financial Engineering. Professor Matteson received his PhD in Statistics from the University of Chicago and his BSB in Finance, Mathematics, and Statistics from the University of Minnesota. He received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation (2015) and a Faculty Research Award from the Xerox/PARC Foundation (2014), and he and his students have received numerous Best Paper Awards.

He is currently an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Statistical Association-Theory & Methods, The American Statistician, Statistica Sinica, and the Journal of Econometrics, and formerly for Biometrics. He is an elected Officer for the Business and Economic Statistics Section of the American Statistical Association, a member of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, the International Biometric Society, the International Society for Bayesian Analysis, and the American Geophysical Union. He is coauthor of Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering, and MOOC instructor for Introduction to Time Series Analysis.

He is lead PI and Director of the NSF funded PRISM Institute for Trans-domain Systemic Risk, lead PI and co-Director of the NSF funded TRIPODS Greater Data Science Cooperative Institute (GDSC), co-PI of the NSF funded Atomic-Level Structural Dynamics in Catalysts Institute, co-PI of a USAID funded Feed-the-Future team, an Executive Committee Member for the Cornell Center for Data Science for Enterprise & Society, and a Visiting Scholar at the Institute for Mathematics and its Applications.

# Biography[English]
I am the H. T. Warshow and Robert Irving Warshow Professor in the Department of Economics at Cornell University. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Economics at Northwestern University, after obtaining a BA and Masters in Economics at the Università degli Studi di Torino (Italy). My research interests are in econometrics, both theoretical and applied. My theoretical work is concerned with the study of identification problems, and with proposing new methods for statistical inference in partially identified models. In my applied work I have focused primarily on the analysis of decision making under risk and uncertainty. I have worked on estimation of risk preferences using market level data, and on the analysis of individuals' probabilistic expectations using survey data.

Francesca Molinari is a professor in the economics department. Her research focuses on econometric theory and applied econometrics. She got her PhD in Economics from Northwestern University and her BS in Economics from the Universita degli Studi di Torino.

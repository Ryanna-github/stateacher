# Biography[English]

Brian is the Gertrude M Cox Distinguished Professor of Statistics at North Carolina State University. He completed his PhD in [Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/) in 2005 under the direction of [Jim Hodges](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~hodges/) of the University of Minnesota. After graduation, he joined NC State first as a post-doc with [Montse Fuentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_Fuentes) and then as a member of the statistics faculty in 2008. His research interests include spatial statistics, extreme value analysis, variable selection and dimension reduction. In addition to these methodological interests, Brian applies these methods to environmental areas such as ecology, air pollution, and climate change, as well as data from the physical and materials sciences.

# Profile

![Kevin Gross](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/04/kevin_gross.jpg)

# Biography[English]

I am a professor in the [](http://www.ncsu.edu/biomath/)[Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](http://www.ncsu.edu/). I am also affilated with NCSU's [Biomathematics Graduate Program](http://www.ncsu.edu/biomath/) and [Department of Applied Ecology](https://appliedecology.cals.ncsu.edu/). 

My main research interests are the science of science and population dynamics. 

John Tukey famously said that one of the attractive aspects of being a statistician was getting to play in everyone's backyard.  I think the same holds true for studying ecological theory. I collaborate with colleagues who study a variety of taxa, and delight in being able to doing so.

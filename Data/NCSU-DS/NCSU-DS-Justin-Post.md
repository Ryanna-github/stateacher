# Biography[English]

Hello and thank you for visiting my web page. I am currently a Teaching Associate Professor and the Director of Online Education in the [Department of Statistics](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/www.stat.ncsu.edu/) at [North Carolina State University](https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~post/www.ncsu.edu/).

I have been involved in the department on and off since 2007. I was a graduate student from 2007-2012 and came back to the university in 2013 in as a Teaching Assistant Professor.

We have one of the largest doctoral programs in the country, a growing [online master's program](https://online.stat.ncsu.edu/online-programs/), a large undergraduate program, and courses that reach students across many fields of study. As awareness of the utility of statistics and data science continues to evolve we continue to grow!

As Director of Online Education I am heading the efforts to improve and grow our online program, update and oversee some of our large undergraduate introductory courses (some sections a hybrid between online and in person), and administer a few of our introductory programming courses (completely flipped courses).

In the past I served as the Director of Undergraduate Research.

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at North Carolina State University. I earned my PhD in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan under the supervision of [Peter X.-K. Song](http://www.umich.edu/~songlab/).

My current methodological interests are

- Data integration, especially of correlated, heterogeneous, high-dimensional data, such as   spatial data,
- Estimating equations and the Generalized Method of Moments,
- Methods that leverage recent computing and algorithmic developments, with a focus on   divide-and-conquer, distributed estimation and inference, and parallel computing.


My current applications interests are

- Metabolomics,
- Neuroimaging,
- Wearable devices.

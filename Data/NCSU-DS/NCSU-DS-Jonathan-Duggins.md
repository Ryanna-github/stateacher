# Profile

![Jonathan Duggins](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/04/jonathan_duggins.jpg)

# Biography[English]

I am an Associate Teaching Professor of Statistics at NC State University where I emphasize  integrating data management and statistical programming skills into a statistics curriculum. My primary focus is training students in SAS; training that is designed based on my experience in industry as well as my experiences when obtaining [my own SAS certifications](https://www.certmetrics.com/SAS/public/candidate_directory_search_detail.aspx?cid=18861). 

My professional efforts outside the classroom include working with the AP Statistics Exam, overseeing undergraduate honors projects, and improving undergraduate access to internship opportunities as the Coordinator of the [Undergraduate Professional Partnership Program](https://up3.stat.ncsu.edu/). 

Before returning to academia, I was a biostatistician for two Contract Research Organizations. As a biostatistician, I designed clinical trials, analyzed resulting data, and provided reports detailing findings to the clinical trials’ sponsors. I was also passionate about developing quality on-the-job educational programs.

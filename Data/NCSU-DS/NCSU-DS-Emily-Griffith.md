# Biography[English]

I'm an Associate Research Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.ncsu.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFezdAQXuPaCs3i2TF8glFCHcONDg) at [North Carolina State University](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncsu.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHgV3vHi6LbTD0iIH8fWNW2E7_hgg).

My interests include statistical consulting and collaboration, teaching, and mentoring. I am also active in the [North Carolina Chapter](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/emilyhgriffith/http%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.amstat.org%2Fnorthcarolina%2Fhome) of the American Statistical Association and served as its President in 2019.

After earning my Ph.D. in statistics from NC State University in 2008, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. In 2009 I began working for the Criminal Justice Information Services in West Virginia, and in 2013 I returned to NCSU as a Research Assistant Professor. I was promoted to Associate Research Professor in 2018.

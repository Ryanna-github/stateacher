# Profile

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics and Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing large and complex datasets in the physical sciences. I am particularly interested in questions related to ill-posed inverse problems, spatio-temporal data, uncertainty quantification and statistical learning in climate science, oceanography, remote sensing and particle physics.

I work in close collaboration with physical scientists and have various ongoing collaborations with oceanographers working on [Argo floats](http://argo.ucsd.edu/), with NASA scientists working on the [OCO-2 mission](https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/) and with particle physicists at [CERN](https://home.cern/).

I coordinate the [Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences (STAMPS)](http://stat.cmu.edu/stamps/) Research Group at CMU together with Ann Lee. I also coordinate the Statistical Oceanography Working Group that started originally at SAMSI and is now hosted at CMU.

I am a Member of the [CMS Experiment](https://cms.cern/) at CERN and a Core Member of the [US CLIVAR Ocean Uncertainty Quantification](https://usclivar.org/working-groups/ocean-uncertainty-quantification-working-group) Working Group.

For publications, see my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x1LQVZoAAAAJ) page. For code and data, see my [Github](https://github.com/mkuusela) page.

# Profile

![Jon Stallrich](https://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2019/04/jon_stallrich.jpg)

# Biography[English]

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Virginia Tech in 2014 under the advisement of John P Morgan.  My research interests initially centered around the design and analysis of experimental data, specifically the development of design selection criteria for targeted parameter inference.  This new approach has been incorporated into JMP Pro’s Custom Design Platform, a leading statistical software package in experimental design. Since joining the department, my research interests have expanded due to my collaborations with NC State researchers in biomedical engineering, material science, computer science, ecology, toxicology, and the Korean language.  These collaborations have led to new contributions and insights into spatial sampling, Bayesian optimization, penalized estimation, and functional data analysis. My research has been externally funded by NSF, NASA, NSA, and NIH.

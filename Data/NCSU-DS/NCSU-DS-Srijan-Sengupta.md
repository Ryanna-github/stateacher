# Biography[English]

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Statistics at [North Carolina State University](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/https%3A%2F%2Fstatistics.sciences.ncsu.edu%2F), where I have been working since Aug 2020. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstat.illinois.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGgtAMu267ZlmlCdjYrYOTTCT2XSA) in Jul 2016. From Aug 2016 to Aug 2020, I was a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Virginia Tech](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stat.vt.edu%2F).  Here's my  [CV.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNZxs1nHzWX2BgCUEbIMICTAnpCQ3aGY/view?usp=sharing) 

I am working on formal inferential algorithms for network data and applying such algorithms to epidemiology, social sciences, and environmental health. I am also working on developing a statistical science of patient safety, focusing on adverse medical events due to human errors, medical devices, drug reactions, and radiation therapy. 

I am grateful for current/ past research support from public funding agencies (NSF and NIH), universities (University of Illinois, Virginia Tech, NCSU), as well as private organizations.

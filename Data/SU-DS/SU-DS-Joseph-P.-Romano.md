# Biography[English]

I grew up in an Italian New Jersey family and was fortunate to attend Princeton where I was influenced by John Tukey and terrific mentor Nick Jewell. I got my Ph.D. from Berkeley in 1986, and am so appreciative that I knew many of the great statisticians of the 20th century, including Erich Lehmann, Lucien LeCam, David Freedman, Rudy Beran, and others. I joined the faculty at Stanford in 1986 when I was 25 and have been at Stanford ever since. My professional life combines intellectual advancement, teaching, and mentoring of young students and researchers by sharing of knowledge and promoting academic integrity. But I also lead a balanced life with passions in music (having performed at Carnegie Hall), tennis (ranked nationally in my age group), cooking, architecture, and other interests.

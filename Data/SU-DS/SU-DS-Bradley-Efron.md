# Biography[English]

I like working on applied and theoretical problems at the same time and one thing nice about statistics is that you can be useful in a wide variety of areas. So my current applications include biostatistics and also astrophysical applications. The surprising thing is that the methods used are similar in both areas. I recently gave a talk at Penn State called "Astrophysics and Biostatistics: The Odd Couple" that made this point.

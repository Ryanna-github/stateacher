# Biography[English]

I am the Ray Lyman Wilbur Professor of Statistics and, by courtesy, of Biomedical Data Science and of the Institute of Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at Stanford University. I am also Co-director of the Center for Innovative Study Design (CISD) at the Stanford University School of Medicine. I have supervised 73 Ph.D. theses and seven postdoctoral trainees. I have published over 300 papers, many of which are in clinical trial design and analysis, population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, survival analysis, longitudinal data analysis, multiple endpoints, biomarkers, adaptive methods, sequential analysis and time series.

My present research areas include sequential experimentation, adaptive design and control, stochastic optimization, time series analysis and forecasting, change-point detection, hidden Markov models and particle filters, empirical Bayes modeling, multivariate survival analysis, probability theory and stochastic processes, biostatistics, econometrics, quantitative finance and risk management. My methodological research in these areas has been motivated by and is closely related to my applied interests in engineering, finance, and the biomedical sciences. As director of the Financial Mathematics Program, co-director of the Biostatistics Core of the Stanford Cancer Institute, and co-director of the Center for Innovative Study Design in the Stanford School of Medicine, I am involved in multiple research projects in these fields.

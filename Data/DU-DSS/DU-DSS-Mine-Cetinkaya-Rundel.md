# Profile

![Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://stat.duke.edu/sites/stat.duke.edu/files/styles/people_photo_thumbnail/public/externals/80bb3a7e1620473198ae8fa7a2c8727f.jpg?itok=tG_EOACg)

# Biography[English]
I am the Director of Undergraduate Studies and an Associate Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.S. in Actuarial Science from New York University’s Stern School of Business. My work focuses on innovation in statistics pedagogy, with an emphasis on student-centered learning, computation, reproducible research, and open-source education.

**Interested in majoring in statistics?**

If you would like to meet to discuss the Statistical Science major, [send me an email](mailto:mine@stat.duke.edu) to schedule an appointment. Also visit the [department website](https://stat.duke.edu/undergraduate-program.html) as many of your questions can also be answered there.

**Pedagogy**

I primarily work on developing pedagogical approaches for teaching statistics with a focus on the introductory statistics classroom, such as active learning, flipped classroom, and team-based learning. I also work on research projects that aim to assess the effectiveness of these approaches with respect to learning, retention, and self-efficacy.

**Statistical computing**

Another area that I am heavily involved in is integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. I also work on ways for supplementing classroom approaches to teaching statistical thinking via events like DataFest, annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set.

**Open-access education**

I am also very active in open access education. I have co-authored three open-source statistics textbooks as part of the [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) project at the introductory college and advanced high school level. Also as part of the open education effort, I have been developing and teaching various [massive open online courses](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/minecetinkayarundel).

**Applied statistics research**

My applied statistics research is mostly driven by interdisciplinary collaborations that arise from statistical consulting. Recently I have worked closely with evolutionary anthropologists on a project using hierarchical modeling, and with medical school researchers on a variety of applied problems.

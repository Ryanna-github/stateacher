# Profile

![Alexander Volfovsky](https://stat.duke.edu/sites/stat.duke.edu/files/styles/people_photo_thumbnail/public/externals/cb81e9af033ae5e59478d221ec4a151e.jpg?itok=Tl1HlOYQ)

# Biography[English]

I am an assistant professor of statistical science and computer science at Duke University. I work primarily on fundamental properties of different statistical concepts with broad inetrests in network analysis, causal inference and computational constraints of statistical methods. I am the Co-Director two labs at Duke: (1) The Polarization Lab at Duke brings together scholars from the social sciences, statistics, and computer science to develop new technology to bridge America’s partisan divide. Check our our newest work on assessing the effects of Russian trolls on political attitudes and behaviors in 2017. (2) The Almost Matching Exactly Lab at Duke brings together statisticians, computer scientists, economists and political scientists to develop tools for interpretable causal inference.

I help run the New Researchers Group at the Institute of Mathematical Statistics which coordinates the Meeting of New Researchers in Statistics and Probability (supported by the National Science Foundation). Plans for our 2021 meeting are coming together so check out the website for new developments (for NRC and the group in general)!

If interested in joining our group to work on exciting problems in statistical methodology for political polarization, network analysis and large scale causal inference, please reach out via email with your CV.

Travel is mainly postponed. Depending on how conferences go online you will find me or members of the lab at AISTATS, UAI, JSM, CMSTATS and others.

Our work is graciously supported by NIH, NSF, ARI, Facebook, and Duke University.

I am interested in theory and methodology for network analysis, causal inference and statistical/computational tradeoffs and in applications in the social sciences. Modern data streams frequently do not follow the traditional paradigms of n independent observations on p quantities of interest. They can include complex dependencies among the observations (e.g. interference in the study of causal effects) or among the quantities of interest (e.g. probabilities of edge formation in a network). My research is concerned with developing theory and methodological tools for approaching such modern data structures by better understanding these underlying dependence structures. My work concentrates on better understanding Kronecker covariance structures as they are related to network analysis and high dimensional unbalanced factorial designs. I work on theory and methodology for high dimensional data as it relates to network analysis, causal inference and computational and statistical tradeoffs. My primary applied interest is in the health and social sciences with past and ongoing collaborations studying friendship formation in high schools, employment outcomes for college graduates and job mobility as a function of an underlying social network.

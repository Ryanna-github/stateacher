# Biography[English]
I am a Professor of [Statistical Science](http://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](http://duke.edu/) and have served as Chair of the Department of Statistical Science at Duke since 2013. I received my PhD in 1993 from the University of Minnesota and joined the faculty at the Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences (now the Department of Statistical Sciences) at Duke University in the fall of 1993. I am a past President of the [International Society of Bayesian Analysis](http://bayesian.org/) (ISBA), and an elected Fellow of ISBA and the American Statistical Association. I received the [Zellner Medal from ISBA](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/news/2016/06/07/news-Zellner-Award.html) in 2016. My research focuses on Bayesian solutions to the related problems of feature/variable selection, model selection and prediction using an ensemble of models to account for model uncertainty using Bayesian Model Averaging, with an emphasis on prior choice and computation.

I have developed several R packages to support research in BMA, including [BAS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BAS/index.html) , Bayesian Adaptive Sampling for Bayesian Model Averaging. My work is inspired by applications in environmental health, chemistry, genomics, neuroscience and astronomy, among others.

In my free time, I enjoy time with my family, [sailing](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~clyde/assets/cassiopeia.jpg) , puttering in the garden, growing orchids, photography, and exploring the Durham food scene and cooking!

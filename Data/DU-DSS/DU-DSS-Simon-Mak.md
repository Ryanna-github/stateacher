# Profile

![Simon Mak](https://stat.duke.edu/sites/stat.duke.edu/files/styles/people_photo_thumbnail/public/externals/845c4614af8f82fa8ecda4592b0c8158.jpg?itok=6-buMHpA)

# Biography[English]
I am an **Assistant Professor** in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstat.duke.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE2EEyCltefipdDdhaoQk9TRERYmw) at Duke University. Prior to Duke, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.isye.gatech.edu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHEGCdNcEPS6LIv3jJfPxbF6C9rSQ) at Georgia Tech.

My research involves integrating **domain knowledge** (e.g., scientific theories, mechanistic models, financial principles) as prior information for statistical inference and prediction. This gives a holistic framework for **interpretable** statistical learning, providing a principled way for scientists to validate theories from data, and for statisticians to integrate scientific knowledge. My research tackles methodological, theoretical, and algorithmic challenges in this integration. This involves building probabilistic models on complex objects (e.g., functions, manifolds, networks), and developing efficient algorithms and data collection methods for model training. Current research is motivated from ongoing projects in nuclear physics, engineering, and finance.

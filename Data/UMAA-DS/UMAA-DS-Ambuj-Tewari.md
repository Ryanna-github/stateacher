# Biography[English]

Dr. Tewari's primary area of research is machine learning. He likes working on the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms as well as finding new application areas for machine learning. Topics he has worked on recently include statistical learning theory, online learning, bandit problems, reinforcement learning, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization for large-scale learning. He is also working on applications of machine learning to problems in behavioral sciences, computational chemistry, computational biology, learning sciences and complex networks

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

 - Statistical learning theory: We are developing theory and algorithms for predictions problems (e.g., learning to rank and multilabel learning) with complex label spaces and where the available human supervision is often weak. Another focus is on dependent and/or non-stationary data (such as in time series applications)
 - Sequential prediction in a game theoretic framework: We are trying to understand the power and limitations of sequential prediction algorithms when no probabilistic assumptions are placed on the data generating mechanism.
 - High dimensional and network data analysis: We are developing scalable algorithms with provable performance guarantees for learning from high dimensional and network data.
 - Optimization algorithms: We are creating incremental, distributed and parallel algorithms for machine learning problems arising in today's data rich world.
 - Reinforcement learning: We are synthesizing and further developing concepts and techniques from artificial intelligence, control theory and operations research for pushing forward the frontier in sequential decision making with a focus on delivering personalized health interventions via mobile devices.

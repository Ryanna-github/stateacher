# Profile

# Biography[English]

I am interested in stochastic processes and time series analysis. In particular, processes with infinite variance, stable distributions. I study their stochastic and statistical properties and develop methods for their computer simulation.

I am also interested in various aspects of the long-range dependence phenomenon. Its modeling in the finite and infinite variance situations and its statistical study. In that context, I have done some work on the estimation of the Hurst long-range dependence parameter by using wavelets.

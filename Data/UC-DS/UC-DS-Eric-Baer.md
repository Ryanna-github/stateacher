# Biography[English]

 I am an Assistant Senior Instructional Professor in the Department of Statistics and the Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago. 

 I have broad interests in applied mathematics, including problems in the calculus of variations, partial differential equations, harmonic analysis, and geometric measure theory. 

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My research interests are in partial differential equations, mathematical analysis, and applied mathematics, with a focus on problems arising in the calculus of variations, harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. Particular areas of my research work include the study of geometric and functional inequalities and their applications, the study of minimizers of geometric variational problems such as those arising in mathematical models for the shapes of liquid drops and crystalline structure, and mathematical issues arising in fluid and solid mechanics.

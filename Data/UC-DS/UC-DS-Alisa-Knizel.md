# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). 

My research focuses on the interplay between probabilistic and algebraic properties of lattice models in statistical mechanics.  My most recent work is related to random matrix theory and interacting particle systems with applications to random growth models, traffic models and combinatorics. My cv is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18RFcP8l7Fe4WbvoofLyykQN-jZzaeJPD/view?usp=sharing).

Before the University of Chicago, I was an NSF postdoctoral fellow in the **[Department of Mathematics](https://math.columbia.edu/)** at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I received my Ph.D. in [mathematics](http://math.mit.edu/) from [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) in 2017, advised by Alexei Borodin.

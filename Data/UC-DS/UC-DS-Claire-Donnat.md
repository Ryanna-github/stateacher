# Biography[English]

My research is at the intersection between Statistics and Machine Learning, and has focused on the statistical analysis of graphs and networks. I am especially interested in applying these methods to the analysis of biomedical data, and in particular, to neuroscience and brain connectomics.

Prior to coming to Chicago, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique with an M.Sc. in Applied Mathematics in 2015, and with a PhD in Statistics from Stanford in 2020, where I was advised by Prof. Susan Holmes.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

My research interests lie in the **analysis of patterns and the quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks, geared towards biomedical applications.**
Indeed, from brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities. Yet, this formalism deviates from its traditional Euclidean counterpart in two essential ways: ***(1) Data points are connected and can therefore no longer be considered as independent.\*** Rather, inference on graphs should be guided by their topological structure and leverage relevant edge, node and neighbourhood information; ***(2) Graph data is irregular:\*** there exists no natural ordering of the nodes, no reference point, nor homogeneity in nodes’ topological roles (degree distribution, betweenness centrality, etc.). These properties imply that graph data is not amenable to analysis through standard Machine Learning (ML) and Statistics methods — and consequently offers a challenging canvas for the re-adaptation of these methods to the graph setting.



In this context, **from the methods perspective**, the research directions that I am currently investigating include:

- 

- **1 - Graph Neural Networks.** As the direct extension of the deep neural network machinery to graph data, GNNs have recently gained an important amount of traction. Yet, despite GNNs’ success on reference datasets in the academic community, both their properties and limitations remain ill-understood. Motivated by the necessity to shift GNNs from a “black-box” model to an actionable ML method that can be explained, trusted and relied upon in practical settings, we currently focus on the analysis, improvement of GNNs and graph algorithms at large, as well as their practical application.

- 

- **2- Network Inference:** While networks offer an attractive formalism to study relational data, in many applications, the raw data has to be substantially processed to infer the graph structure before any network analysis can be achieved. In this setting, network inference is thus a crucial and indispensable component of the "graph analysis" pipeline, and on the quality of which depends any downstream analysis. As a result, we are interested in developping algorithms ablet to infer interactions and associations betweem agents in a network, as well as defining confidence levels around the inferred network structure.

- 

- **3- Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference:** Finally, I am also extremely interested in Bayesian and Probabilistic Graphical models (PGMs). More specifically, I am interested in topics ranging from PGM inference and variational inference.



**From the applications perspective, I am extremely interested in the potential of graphs and probabilistic models to biomedical problems.** I have in the past and am currently continuing on working on biomedical, neuroscience as well as COVID-19 related applications. I am also part of a collaboration working on the reconstruction of protein shape from cryoEM images.

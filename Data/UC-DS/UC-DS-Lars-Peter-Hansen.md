# Biography[English]

Lars Peter Hansen is a leading expert in economic dynamics who works at the forefront of economic thinking and modeling, drawing approaches from macroeconomics, finance, and statistics. He is a recipient of the [2013 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2013/hansen-facts.html)

Hansen has made fundamental advances in our understanding of how economic agents cope with changing and risky environments. He has contributed to the development of statistical methods designed to explore the interconnections between macroeconomic indicators and assets in financial markets. These methods are widely used in empirical research in financial economics today.

The Nobel Prize recognizes this work, which has been used to test theories and models that have shaped our modern understanding of asset pricing.  His recent research explores how to quantify intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs and ways to model economic behavior when consumers and investors struggle with uncertainty about the future. Improving models that measure risk and uncertainty have important implications for financial markets, fiscal policy, and the macroeconomy.

His early research in econometrics was aimed at developing time series statistical methods to investigate one part of an economic model without having to fully specify and estimate all of the model ingredients. The applications he explored with several coauthors, such as Kenneth J. Singleton, Scott F. Richard, Robert Hodrick, and Ravi Jagannathan, included systems that are rich enough to support models of asset valuation and to identify and clarify empirical puzzles, where real-world financial and economic data were at odds with prevailing academic models.

Hansen’s recent work focuses on uncertainty and its relationship to long run risks in the macroeconomy. He explores how models that incorporate ambiguities, beliefs, and skepticism of consumers and investors can explain economic and financial data and reveal the long-term consequences of policy options. Hansen, Thomas J. Sargent, and their coauthors have recently developed methods for modeling economic decision-making in environments in which uncertainty is hard to quantify.  They explore the consequences for models with financial markets and characterize environments in which the beliefs of economic actors are fragile.

Hansen joined the faculty of the [University of Chicago’s](http://www.uchicago.edu/) [Department of Economics](http://economics.uchicago.edu/) in 1981 and has served as department chairman and director of graduate studies. He is now David Rockefeller Distinguished Service Professor of Economics, Statistics, Booth School of Business and the College. He was the inaugural director of the Becker Friedman Institute until July of 2017. **[Read Lars’ personal reflection on the beginnings of the Becker Friedman Institute here](http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BFI320318_Lars-Peter_Hansen-BFI_Interactive_TOC.pdf)**. He currently directs the **[Macro Finance Research Program](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/programs/macro-finance-research-program/)** housed under the Becker Friedman Institute. 

Hansen also serves as co-principal investigator, along with Andrew Lo of MIT, on the [Macro Financial Modeling Project (MFM)](http://www.mfmgroup.org/). This research group works to develop macroeconomic models with enhanced linkages to financial markets, with the aim of providing better policy tools for monitoring so-called systemic risks to the economy.

In addition to the Nobel prize, Hansen has also received many other awards and honors. Hansen won the 2010 [BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in the Economics, Finance and Management](http://www.fbbva.es/TLFU/tlfu/ing/microsites/premios/fronteras/galardonados/2010/economia.jsp) “for making fundamental contributions to our understanding of how economic actors cope with risky and changing environments.” He also received the [CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications](http://www.msri.org/general_events/18628) in 2008 and the [Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics](http://www.nemmers.northwestern.edu/) from Northwestern University in 2006. In 1984, he and Kenneth J. Singleton were awarded the Frisch Medal from the Econometric Society for their paper, “Generalized Instrumental Variables Estimation of Nonlinear Rational Expectations Models.”

Hansen is a fellow of the [National Academy of Sciences](http://www.nasonline.org/) and the [American Finance Association](http://www.afajof.org/). He also is a member of the [American Academy of Arts and Sciences](http://www.amacad.org/) and past president of the [Econometric Society](http://www.econometricsociety.org/).

He has delivered numerous lectures around the world. In 2016, he presented the CORE Nobel Talk at the Université catholique de Louvain, and in 2015 he presented the LAUNCH Distinguished Lecture at the University of Illinois and the W.P. Carey Lecture at Colorado College. He was the 2014 lecturer at the IGIER Seminar Series at  Università Bocconi and lectured at the 1st Macro Finance Workshop of the Macro Finance Society at Ohio State University. Hansen gave the Princeton Lectures in Finance at the Bendheim Center for Finance in December 2010, the Tjalling C. Koopmans Memorial Lectures at Yale in September 2008, and the Third Toulouse Lectures in Economics at the Université de Toulouse in May 2005.

Hansen holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics and political science from [Utah State University](http://www.usu.edu/) and a doctorate in economics from the [University of Minnesota](http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/index.html).  Hansen has also received numerous honorary degrees, including an honorary doctorate from Utah State University in 2012.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

Lars Peter Hansen is a leading expert in economic dynamics who works at the forefront of economic thinking and modeling. He draws approaches from macroeconomics, finance, and statistics.

Hansen’s current work investigates three interconnecting areas: **(1) macroeconomic uncertainty and financial markets;** **(2)** **struggling with a complex future;** and **(3) understanding investor beliefs through asset market data.**

**1. Tackling Uncertainty When Confronting Climate Change**

Hansen and his collaborators develop and apply methods for confirming uncertainty and its impacts, broadly speaking, for the design and conduct of public policy. This research brings tools from decision theory and asset pricing to study uncertainty evaluation including the particular ramifications for the social cost of carbon.

Specifically, Hansen places emphasis on **quantitative storytelling** as a credible way to conduct policy analysis in dynamic settings. It combines so-called “stylized modeling” with empirical evidence. Hansen and his co-authors purposefully consider multiple stories, with carefully worked-out narratives that are formally captured as models, which have different ramifications for the environment and the economy. For dynamic problems such as the one of climate uncertainty, multiple “stories” are virtually impossible to dismiss on either theoretical or empirical grounds.

In their quantitative application, Hansen and his collaborators show that the social cost of carbon could become very large without additional forms of mitigation, technological change, adaptation and/or policy intervention. They abstract from regional and developmental heterogeneity, which should be part of a more full accounting. Of course, these limitations should be explored and they will alter the implied social cost of carbon. They are actively engaged in revealing extensions that will allow us to confront some of these shortcomings along with more ambitious climate inputs. In summary, this paper is not meant as **the answer,** but as their initial step in incorporating broad notions of uncertainty in a formal policy analysis while avoiding overstated claims of our current knowledge base.

- “Pricing Uncertainty Induced by Climate Change”

  (with William ‘Buz’ Brock and Michael Barnett), published in the Review of Financial Studies, February 2020.

**2. Struggling with a Complex Future**

Hansen and his collaborators explore important questions about the consequences for financial markets when investors are unsure about the future.

Formal and informal evidence from financial markets suggests that the markets vary over time in their concerns about uncertainty. What drives these fluctuations and how are they related to speculations about future macroeconomic performance? How should public policy be designed given our incomplete understanding how policy impacts the economy in subtle and not so subtle ways.

To investigate these issues formally requires a modeling framework where investors within the model sometimes struggle with how to make projections about future economic performance and even about which model is the best one to use

Hansen and his coauthors study how different forms of uncertainty, including risk, ambiguity and their resulting skepticism, impact financial market performance. They seek to advance understanding about the implications of uncertainty, especially for behavior of markets and the design of economic policy.

**3. The Pricing Impact of Macroeconomic Uncertainty**

Applied macroeconomic research quantifies how random impulses or “shocks” to the dynamic economic system transmit throughout the economy and  affect  outcomes over time.

Hansen’s recent collaborative research aims to assign prices to these shocks by building on and extending insights from asset pricing theory.

In financial markets, we know that investors are compensated for their exposure to added macroeconomic uncertainty, but we don’t yet know how or by how much. Hansen’s research seeks to answer the question, “What are the implied investor compensations for exposure to macroeconomic shocks over alternative payoff or investment horizons?”  

Thus, his work is designed to provide a pricing counterpart to the impulse response functions used by macroeconomists. The drive to  identify the long-term impacts of uncertainty motivates this work, and as a result, features revealing characterizations of the importance of the contributions to pricing that persist over time.

**4. Investor beliefs as revealed by asset market data**

Asset markets are forward-looking. They encode information about investor beliefs about the future and about investors’ concerns for risk. How can we use financial market data to extract information about these two components in a reliable way? Financial market prices can change because investors change their subjective beliefs about the future and because the risk prices that they are exposed to change. This research, which Hansen pursues with his collaborators, investigates this question by formally exploring the interplay among , investors’ beliefs, rational expectations, and the long-term consequences of exposure to risk.

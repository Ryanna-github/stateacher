# Profile

![Jeremy Hoskins](https://d3qi0qp55mx5f5.cloudfront.net/stat/i/people/Faculty/Hoskins_Jeremy_600x600.jpg?mtime=1600283348)

# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.

My research is primarily focused on fast algorithms and numerical analysis. I am also interested in inverse problems, optics, and problems arising in medical imaging.

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]

I am interested in problems at the interface between physics, computation, and mathematics. A major theme of my research is studying the mathematical foundations of problems arising in imaging; particularly what happens in highly-scattering and quantum systems. Along with this, I also work on developing of fast, efficient, and accurate algorithms for solving large scale problems such as those arising in the simulation of complex optical systems. These methods have broad applications in many other disciplines such as signal processing, genomics, acoustics, and medical imaging.

# Biography[English]
Dr. Haibo Zhou is a full professor with tenure in the Department of Biostatistics at UNC-Chapel Hill. He is also the director for the Biostatistics Core at the Center for Environmental Medicine, Asthma and Lung Biology.

He has over 100 peer-reviewed publications, many of extremely high quality, in top biostatistical and subject matter journals. He is well-known for his biostatistical research in environmental statistics, outcome-dependent sampling, survival analysis, measurement error problems and reproductive epidemiology.  

Dr. Zhou has served as PI on four NIH-funded R01 grants on statistical methodology research in outcome-dependent sampling design. He has had outstanding collaborative experiences with researchers at UNC, NIEHS and EPA on important health studies. His outcome-dependent sampling research is focused on developing innovative and cost-effective sampling designs that will enable investigators to collect more informative samples at a fixed budget.

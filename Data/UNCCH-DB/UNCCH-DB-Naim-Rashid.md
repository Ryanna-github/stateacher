# Profile

![Naim Rashid](https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2021/06/rashid_naim_738x714.jpg)

# Biography[English]
I am an [assistant professor](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/naim-rashid-phd/) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/) at the [Gillings School of Global Public Health](https://sph.unc.edu/) at UNC-CH, with a joint appointment at the [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/). My methodological work spans several areas in genomics and statistics, addressing problems facing basic science, translational, and clinical researchers in cancer.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with [Giovanni Parmigiani](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/giovanni-parmigiani/) in the [Department of Data Sciences](https://www.dana-farber.org/research/departments-centers-and-labs/departments-and-centers/department-of-data-sciences/) at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/) at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (joint with Nikhil Munshi). I earned my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at UNC under the direction of Joseph Ibrahim and Wei Sun.
# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]
*   Precision medicine, high throughput epigenomics (ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq,etc.), multi-study learning, gene signature replicability, model-based clustering, alternative splicing (RNA-seq), proteomics, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Additional detail can be found under [Projects](https://naimurashid.github.io/projects/) and [Students](https://naimurashid.github.io/students/).
    
*   **Collaborative Work:** As a member of the Lineberger Biostatistics Core I assist physicians and researchers with statistical problems relating to genomics and clinical studies. I am available for basic statistical consulting queries for all Lineberger Members.
    
*   **Cancer Clinical Trials:** I help oncologists design cancer clinical trials at UNC and elsewhere, serving as trial statistician on a number of active protocols. I am also a part of the [Translational Breast Cancer Research Consortium](http://pub.emmes.com/study/bcrc/) Statistical Working Group, where I develop and review novel clinical trials in breast cancer with oncologists nationwide.
    
*   **Teaching:** I teach a course on Statistical Computing, [BIOS 735](https://biodatascience.github.io/statcomp/), to PhD Students at Gillings, covering topics such R programming, various statistical and computational algorithms, and machine learning models.

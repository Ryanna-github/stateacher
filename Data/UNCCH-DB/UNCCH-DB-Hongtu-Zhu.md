# Profile

![Hongtu Zhu](https://sph.unc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/112/2021/07/Zhu_Hongtu_2008_738x714.jpg)

# Biography[English]
Dr. Hongtu Zhu is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics.  
  
He has a broad background in statistics, biostatistics, medical imaging, genetics and computational neuroscience, with specific training and expertise in neuroimaging data analysis and big data integration as well as secondary data analysis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases.  

As a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow, he developed various new statistical methods for analyzing genetic, behavioral and clinical data from cross-sectional, longitudinal and family studies, and solved associated statistical issues (e.g., estimation, hypothesis testing).  

As a faculty member at Columbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, he expanded his research to develop new statistical methods for the analysis of medical imaging data including magnetic resonance images (MRI), DTI, EEG/MEG, Ultra Sound, fMRI and PET.

# Biography[English]

Andrew Nobel is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics and in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research, and is a full member of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. A UNC faculty member for 21 years, his research spans statistical theory, methodology, and applications, with an emphasis on machine learning, network analysis, and statistical genomics.   

His current research aims to understand and identify the genomic factors that underly both the differentiation of human tissues and the etiology and treatment of diseases such as cancer.  Nobel has active, long-standing collaborations with researchers at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, and has collaborated with faculty from a number of departments at UNC, including Biology, Computer Science, Genetics, and Mathematics.  He is a fellow of the Institute for Mathematical Statistics and currently a member of the editorial board of the _Annals of Statistics_.

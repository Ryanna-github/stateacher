# Biography[English]
Dr. Kinh Truong is a professor in the Department of Biostatistics.  
  
Dr. Truong's main research focus is to develop new statistical methods that will spatially localize dynamic processes in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) human brain data. His teaching and research experience in linear mixed modeling has provided new insights and approaches to many statistical analysis for handling between- and within-subject variability.  
  
He has contributed significantly in the areas of statistical time series/longitudinal modeling using splines, window- or kernel-based smoothing methods and wavelets.

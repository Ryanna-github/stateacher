# Biography[English]
Xianming Tan is a research associate professor in the Department of Biostatistics and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His area of research focuses on the development of statistical methods for studying population heterogeneity based on various types of data. He also engages in collaborative studies at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, working with physicians and researchers on population studies and clinical studies. Prior to coming to UNC, he was a biostatistician at McGill University Health Centre.
# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]
Dr. Tan’s research interests include statistical methods relevant to the design and analysis of clinical trials, finite mixture models and their applications to revealing population heterogeneity, and interdisciplinary research. A converge of these interests also leads to the development of appropriate methodologies to more adequately explore the potentials of intensive longitudinal data for answering scientific questions. He is also involved in collaborative studies at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, working with physicians and researchers on clinical studies.

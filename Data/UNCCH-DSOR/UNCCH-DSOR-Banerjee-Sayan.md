# Profile

![Banerjee Sayan](https://casdev4.oasis.unc.edu/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/bannerjee_sayan.jpg)

# Biography[English]
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. I obtained my undergraduate and master’s education at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, from 2005-2010 before moving to the Mathematics Department, University of Washington, Seattle, where I finished my Ph.D. in mathematics in 2013 under the supervision of Prof. Krzysztof Burdzy. I was a Research Fellow in the Statistics Department, University of Warwick, UK, from November 2013- June 2016, working with Prof. Wilfrid Kendall, before moving to UNC.

I work in probability theory. My recent focus has been coupling, geometry and ergodicity of diffusion processes, dynamic random networks and interacting particle systems. I have also worked on random walks in random environments and random matrices.

In my spare time, I love hanging out in coffee shops with friends, strumming at my guitar as I hum along, or just binge watching TV series on Netflix!

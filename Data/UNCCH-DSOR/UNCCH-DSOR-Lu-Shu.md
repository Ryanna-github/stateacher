# Biography[English]
I am currently Professor at Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Civil Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2000 and 2002, and Master’s degrees in Mathematics and in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2006, and Doctor’s degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2007.
# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]
I do research in the general area of mathematical optimization, trying to understand the structure behind continuous optimization problems and exploit such structure in solution analysis and algorithm design. I am particularly interested in developing procedures to quantitatively measure the effect of uncertainty in optimization problems, as well as novel algorithms to solve stochastic optimization problems.

Topics I have worked on include sensitivity analysis of variational inequalities, the constant rank constraint qualification, confidence regions and intervals for stochastic variational inequalities, sensitivity analysis of traffic user equilibria, and statistical inference for sparse penalized statistical regression. Below is a list of my professional publications.

# Profile

![Giacomazzo Mario](https://casdev4.oasis.unc.edu/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/giacomazzo_mario.jpg)

# Biography[English]
The bulk of my Ph.D. research has been allocated to time series analysis under both Frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. The primary objective in time series analysis is to identify the model that describes the underlying dynamics and minimizes future forecasting error. The foundation of time series analysis was established to answer applied questions in finance and economics where current monetary policy is developed based on predicted future behavior. The two applications to which I have dedicated considerable time have been outside finance and economics.

# Biography[English]
I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics and Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill. I do research in Applied Probability, in particular, I work on problems involving heavy-tailed phenomena. My current work is focused on the analysis of information ranking algorithms and their large-scale behavior, which is closely related to the study of the solutions to certain stochastic recursions constructed on weighted branching processes. I am also interested in the analysis of complex networks, in particular, scale-free random graphs such as those used to model the web and other social networks. Some of my ongoing projects include the study of queueing networks with parallel servers and synchronization constraints and the development of efficient simulation algorithms for computing the solutions to branching distributional equations.

# Education[English]
I earned Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México, ITAM, and I hold a Master’s degree in Statistics from Stanford University. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, where I worked on problems related to the single-server queue with heavy-tailed processing times.

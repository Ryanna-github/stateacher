# Profile

![Zhang Zhengwu](https://casdev.unc.edu/stor/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2021/02/zhang_zhengwu.jpg)

# Biography[English]
Zhengwu Zhang is an assistant professor in Statistics and Operations Research at UNC Chapel Hill. He was an assistant professor in Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Neuroscience at the University of Rochester from 2017 to 2020. Before his tenure-track positions, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute (SAMSI) and Duke University. He got his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Florida State University in May 2015 under Professor Anuj Srivastava's supervision.

His primary research interests lie in developing effective statistical and machine learning methods for high-dimensional “objects” with low-dimensional underlying structures. Examples of these objects include images, surfaces, networks, and time-indexed paths on non-linear manifolds, coming from neuroscience, computer vision, epidemiology, genomics, and meteorology.

Most of his recent research focuses on developing novel machine learning methods to extract knowledge from large neuroimaging datasets. With advancements of in-vivo brain imaging techniques, large-scale neuroimaging datasets containing more than 10k subjects can be easily accessed now. With large samples, we can gain more statistical power, a narrower margin of error, and reproducible results, but we also face modeling and computational challenges. He is dedicated to discovering efficient, elegant, and practical solutions to these challenges.

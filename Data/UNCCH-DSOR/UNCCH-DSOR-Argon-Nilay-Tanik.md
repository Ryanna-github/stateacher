# Profile

![Argon Nilay Tanık](https://casdev4.oasis.unc.edu/statistics/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/05/argon_nilay.jpg)

# Biography[English]

My research expertise and interests are in the areas of analysis, design, and control of stochastic systems and output analysis for discrete-event simulations. I study operational problems that arise in manufacturing and service environments with a particular emphasis on healthcare systems. Most operational problems that I study involve allocation of scarce resources, such as ambulances or workers among competing customers, with the objective of optimizing a certain performance measure.

I employ stochastic operations research techniques, such as Markov decision processes, sample-path analysis, approximation methods, and simulation, to propose and analyze decision rules and designs that perform well and are also practical. In recent years, I have particularly focused on using a more data-oriented approach in my projects on healthcare systems.

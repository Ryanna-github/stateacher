# Biography[English]

# Biography[中文]

# Interests[English]
My research is in convex programming, especially in semidefinite programming, and conic linear programming. A few years back I also did research in integer programming. I also have several papers on applications of optimization.

My main research area, which is closest to my heart, is on Semidefinite Programs (SDPs), some of the most exciting, and useful class of optimization problems of the last few decades.

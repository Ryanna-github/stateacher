# Biography[English]

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. My research focuses on developing statistical methods for analyzing large and complex datasets in the physical sciences. I am particularly interested in questions related to ill-posed inverse problems, spatio-temporal data, uncertainty quantification and statistical learning in climate science, oceanography, remote sensing and particle physics.

I work in close collaboration with physical scientists and have various ongoing collaborations with oceanographers working on Argo floats, with NASA scientists working on the OCO-2 mission and with particle physicists at CERN.

I coordinate the Statistical Methods for the Physical Sciences (STAMPS) Research Group at CMU together with Ann Lee. I also coordinate the Statistical Oceanography Working Group that started originally at SAMSI and is now hosted at CMU.

I am a Member of the CMS Experiment at CERN and a Core Member of the US CLIVAR Ocean Uncertainty Quantification Working Group.

For publications, see my Google Scholar page. For code and data, see my Github page.
